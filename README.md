## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
## Tasks
Use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.
## Approach
Use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Utilize Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
## Resources
HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, Leaflet 1.7.1, D3.js 6.2.0, Mapbox
